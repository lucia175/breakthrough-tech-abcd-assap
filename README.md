## **Project Overview**  
This project tackles the challenge of turning unstructured data (conversations between two humans) into structured data with LLMs. </br>
Our desired outcome is to develop an API or tool that effectively converts free text conversations into structured data.  

## **Objectives and Goals**  
- **Primary Objective**: Ever felt overwhelmed by the chaos of unstructured data? Our project leverages Generative AI to bring order to the mess.
  
- **Goals**:
  - Structure human conversation data using LLMs: Utilizing the latest advancements in Large Language Models to convert free-text conversations into structured data formats like JSON.
  - Define tasks, data requirements, and evaluation criteria: Establish clear objectives, necessary data inputs, and metrics for success to guide our project.
  - Test and explore various LLM-based transformation methods: Experiment with different LLM techniques to find the most effective methods for transforming conversation data.
accurately.

### **Data Preparation and Preprocessing**  
1. Conducted Data Understanding: Reviewed data files, and clarified ambiguities with the challenge advisor
2. Data Cleaning and Formatting: Removed inconsistencies and standardized data structure
3. Created Input-Output Relationship Array: Structured data to link input with output for modeling
---

## **Modeling and Evaluation**  
We used llama 2, which is an advanced language model for structuring data, and it results in 95% accuracy
---

## **Results and Key Findings**  
We were able to develop a model that provides us with these insights, provides us with these patterns, and shows us a wide variety of how these things are identified and extracted to make something useful in turn.
  
- Data Patterns: Identified frequent conversational themes and common customer inquiries.
- Model Performance: Achieved high accuracy in converting unstructured data to structured formats.
- Business Insights: Uncovered trends in customer interactions that can drive strategic decisions.
---

### **Visualizations**  
- Conversation flow between a customer and an agent.
- Overall quality scores or response times for various test cases
---

### **Potential Next Steps**  
- Model Enhancement: further fine-tuning of hyperparameters.
- Feature Expansion: Integrating additional data sources to enrich the model.
- User Feedback: Incorporating user feedback to refine the model's accuracy and relevance.
- Deployment: Moving towards deployment in a live environment for real-time data processing.
